  title={Consumer Information Friction and Monetary Non-Neutrality: A Sequential Search Approach (Updated in May 2025!)},
  school={Northwestern University},
  author={Xiaojie Liu},
  year={2024},
  note={Job Market Paper},
  abstract={This paper develops a model of monetary non-neutrality driven solely by consumer-side information frictions, in contrast to standard approaches that rely on firm-side nominal rigidities.  Consumers face search frictions when shopping for goods and have imperfect information about the average nominal marginal cost. The key mechanism is that, following a monetary shock, consumers attribute some of the resulting price changes to firm-specific adverse shocks, inducing them to search for alternatives. To dissuade search, firms compress the markup and limit the passthrough of the shock to prices. Firms still pass through idiosyncratic shocks flexibly, while responses to aggregate shocks are dampened due to weakened strategic complementarities by consumers' information friction. Building on this mechanism, I develop a tractable medium-scale DSGE model that can be efficiently solved using sequence-space methods. Estimating the model via impulse response matching, I find the degree of information friction to be substantial, accounting for 65% of observed monetary non-neutrality. I further consider aggregate productivity shocks and apply it to interpret the post-pandemic inflation surge. Finally, I provide two pieces of empirical evidence that support the model’s core mechanisms.},

  title={A Framework for Economic Growth with Capital-Embodied Technical Change},

  year={2024},
  journal={American Economic Review},
  doi={https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20221180},
  abstract={Technological advance is often embodied in capital inputs, like computers, airplanes, and robots. This paper builds a framework where capital inputs advance through (i) increased automation and (ii) increased productivity. The interplay of these two innovation dimensions can produce balanced growth, satisfying the Uzawa Growth Theorem even though technological progress is capital-embodied. The framework can further address structural transformation, general-purpose technologies, the limited macroeconomic impact of computing, and declining productivity growth and labor shares. Overall, this tractable framework can help resolve puzzling tensions between micro-level observations of innovation and balanced growth while providing new perspectives on numerous macroeconomic phenomena.},

@article{Confusion,
  title={Confusion, Phillips Curves and De-anchored Inflation},
  author={Xiaojie Liu and Dalton Zhang},
  year={2024},
  note={Working Paper},
  abstract={We investigate inflation dynamics when firms are uncertain about the causes of aggregate fluctuations and use prices and output as learning tools. During periods of low inflation, firms observing increased output attribute this change partly to positive demand and partly to positive supply factors, resulting in a dampened pricing response. Consequently, demand shocks are near non-inflationary. On the contrary, supply shocks are strongly inflationary, given that supply shocks directly change firms' marginal cost while expectations about aggregate inflation and output is dampened. As inflation escalates, firms raise prices in response to either perceived positive demand or negative supply shocks, triggering a self-fulfilling cycle of de-anchored inflation. Supported by survey evidence, our model can generate realistic monetary non-neutrality and explains occasional inflation de-anchoring. This model explains the business cycle puzzle of inflation disconnect and flattened Phillips curve, and also offers new insights into inflation dynamics and monetary policy implications.},

@article{pricing frictions and innovation,
  title={Pricing Frictions and Innovation},
  author={Xiaojie Liu and Sara Moreira},
  year={2024},
  note={Working Paper},
  abstract={This paper studies the relationship between pricing and product innovation decisions. Using detailed product- and firm-level data, we find new evidence of price frictions in incumbent products over their life cycle and their association with product innovation rates and the price levels of new products. Our findings suggest that the nominal price of an existing product barely increases over the long term. Instead, the rise in the nominal price index is largely driven by the introduction of new products. Firms tend to charge a high price premium on new products, a phenomenon we term ”price overshooting”. We develop a dynamic endogenous growth model within a monetary economy and demonstrate that, in an environment with pricing frictions,  the option value of setting a new price incentivizes firms to innovate. Anticipating price rigidity over a product’s life cycle, firms overshoot prices at the initial stage of product introduction.},

@article{Complementarity,
  title={Strategic Complementarity in Price Setting: Evidence from Retail Industry},
  author={Xiaojie Liu},
  year={2024},
  note={Working in Progress},
  abstract={Strategic complementarities in firm price setting are crucial in shaping macroeconomic outcomes. This paper offers the first empirical estimate of retailers’ price responses to competitor price changes, leveraging large-scale Nielsen data on prices and sales. To address reverse endogeneity, we introduce a novel instrumental variable strategy based on DellaVigna and Gentzkow (2020). In contrast to Amiti, Itskhoki, and Konings (2019), who show strong complementarity in the manufacturing sector, we find weaker evidence of strategic complementarity, with a typical firm adjusting its price with an elasticity of 0.14 in response to competitors’ price changes. To explain this discrepancy, we develop a theoretical framework that incorporates two buyer-side frictions: (i) search frictions and (ii) information frictions regarding sectoral shocks. Our findings indicate that strategic complementarity is highly sensitive to the level of information frictions. Finally, we provide suggestive evidence that buyers in the retail sector, typically households, may have less information on sectoral shocks.},
