I am a Ph.D. candidate in Managerial Economics and Strategy at Northwestern University Kellogg School of Management. My research interests include business cycle and growth.  In my research, I propose minimalist theory to explain empirically documented phenomena. 

I will be on the 2024-2025 job market. 

Previously, I received Master in Economics summa cum laude from Sciences Po and  B.S. with honors in Electrical Engineering from Fudan University.
